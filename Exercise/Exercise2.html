				<p>The Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update for the Samsung Galaxy S II has been a long time coming but it seems that the wait is soon to get over. Although Samsung did earlier mention that the S II, along with a few other Samsung devices will be getting the update sometime in March, it did not provide the actual date.
				Now, however, a Samsung importer in Isreal called Sunny Communications have revealed on its Facebook page that the update will arrive on March 15, just over a week from today. Here is the translated quite from Facebook:
				We promised that we're working on it. You waited patiently. On 15 March it comes: the Android version 4, ICS, tens of thousands of the devices purchased GALAXY SII cellular companies in the country or directly from us. We here are very excited for the launch, hope you.
				This does not mean, however, that all Galaxy S II devices will get the update on March 15. Some may get it later or probably, some may even get it sooner, with the date mentioned above probably being only for the Israeli market. Either way, you won't be having to wait too long now.				
				The development of the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich update for the Samsung Galaxy S II and Galaxy Note is obviously progressing according to schedule. The Norwegian branch of the South Korean company just confirmed that the update is due to arrive at the end of this quarter, which means that there are just a couple of months left before the wait is finally over.</p>
				<p>The Ice Cream Sandwich update will bring lots of new features to the Galaxy S II and Galaxy Note, including a new task manager, better notification manager and vastly improved browser in terms of both functionality and performance.
				You may remember that we got to play with one of the leaked ICS ROMs for the Samsung Galaxy S II a while ago and we were quite happy with its functionality. Unfortunately it was still quite buggy and not really suitable for everyday use.
				Since that moment several new Samsung-made (but not meant for public release) ROMs popped up for the Galaxy S II and they show that the Samsung R&D engineers are actually advancing quite rapidly.
				The latest version available is I9100XXLP6 and it's arguably the first one ready to fill in as your main ROM. It does lots of bug fixing and performance tuning and while it's some way off perfection, it's good enough for most geeks. Plus, it enables the Face unlock feature, which is one of the coolest (if not particularly functional) parts of ICS.
				f you feel like taking the ROM for a spin and you know what you are doing you may download the necessary files by following this link. The rest of you should at least sleep better knowing that there are just a couple of months remaining now until the official update hits.
				The leaked I9100XXKPA ROM is a major step forward compared to the previously leaks, bringing improved battery life, touch responsiveness and faster performance.Now we guess you could use that as your everyday ROM, but we don’t think it really worth it at this point. The newly added features aren’t all that many and they aren’t enough to make up for all the performance glitches. Then again, having an ICS ROM on your Galaxy S II months before everyone else will give you some bragging rights and that might be worth something as well.</p>
